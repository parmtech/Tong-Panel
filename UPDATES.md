# Tong Panel — Live Project Status and Work Journal
**Updated:** 2026-10-27 (Sydney)
**Project:** ParmTech Tong Panel (https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel)  
**Maintained by:** any authorized contributor/agent who commits changes.  
**Rule:** This file is a **manual committed source of truth**, not an automatic background process. Every meaningful work session should update checkpoint and log.

## LATEST VERIFIED WORK — 2026-10-27, Phase 1 (SQLite queue slice partial)
- **PR:** [Draft #14 — P1 Core Foundation](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/pull/14), branch `feature/p1-core-foundation` (not merged).
- **Changed files:** `internal/preflight/doctor.go`, `internal/preflight/doctor_test.go`, new `docs/READ_ONLY_DOCTOR.md` on PR branch.
- **Working functionality:** `tongctl doctor` now reads candidate OS, available RAM, root filesystem free space, and TCP LISTEN 80/443 from /proc, returning explicit pass/warn/block JSON. Does not modify server or bind ports.
- **Local tests:** `go test -race ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...` passed; container Debian 13 report correctly blocked unsupported initial distro candidate.
- **GitHub Actions verified:** [Go checks run #40262321339](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/actions/runs/40262321339) **success**, gofmt + go test -race + go vet.
- **Not done:** production install, VM distro certification, kernel/cloud firewall verification, installer rollback, host agent security audit, secure auth, SQL data store and work queues. **Phase 1 remains IN PROGRESS.**
- **Next one action:** implement reviewed production auth/session architecture (#6) or continue safe installer diagnostics (#11), then update this file with tests and commits. Read AGENTS.md and open PR #14 before starting.

## LATEST SESSION — 2026-10-27 10:51 Australia/Sydney, P1 SQLite queue slice
- **Branch:** `feature/p1-sqlite-transactional-queue`, created from the head of draft PR #15 (`feature/p1-auth-sessions-sqlite`); stacked above draft PR #14. This branch has not yet been pushed or opened as a PR.
- **Scope:** issue #7, a Go SQLite migration runner and non-executing transactional queue prototype; no changes to the live VPS.
- **Code:** schema moved to `internal/database/migrations/0001_initial.sql` and embedded in a Go opener; added a pinned cgo-free SQLite driver, connection pragmas, single-connection pool, transactional enqueue and validated transition prototype, tenant-filtered reads, and Windows-compatible directory sync for the existing JSON journal tests.
- **Tests actually run:** Go 1.25.14 Windows/amd64 focused tests passed for `internal/database`, `internal/jobs`, `internal/api`, `internal/auth`, `internal/health`, `cmd/tongd` and `internal/rbac`; `go vet` passed for those packages; `go build ./cmd/tongd` passed.
- **Not passed/not run:** full `go test ./...` is blocked on existing Linux-only `internal/preflight` syscall usage on Windows; `go test -race ./...` cannot run because the Windows environment lacks CGO; Python schema tests were not run because Python is unavailable. The repository's Linux CI must validate full race tests and Python schema workflow after push. No remote checks have run for this branch yet.
- **Auth limitations:** no production login, Argon2id verifier, durable sessions, TOTP enrollment/replay protection, CSRF/Origin middleware, rate limiting or authenticated API wiring. Existing session manager is still memory-only; API remains on the JSON journal.
- **Queue limitations:** only `validation.noop` is accepted; no worker, lease/retry loop, audit event integration, locking, recovery or host operation exists. The SQLite store is not wired into `tongd` pending actor identity and ADR/threat review.
- **Dependency/security:** `modernc.org/sqlite` v1.34.5 is pinned; upstream package metadata identifies BSD-3-Clause and SQLite public domain. Full transitive licence inventory and ADR-003 review remain open.
- **Phase:** P1 remains IN PROGRESS. No Phase 1 acceptance or production-readiness claim.
- **Next one action:** push this isolated branch and open a draft PR based on PR #15, then inspect the actual GitHub Actions results and update this entry with the PR/commit/check run evidence.

### 2026-10-26 — P1 agent socket hardening (additional update)
- **Branch:** `feature/p1-core-foundation`, unmerged [draft PR #14](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/pull/14).
- **Files:** `internal/agent/agent_linux.go` and `internal/agent/agent_linux_test.go`.
- **Changes:** removed process-global umask mutation, require an owned private non-symlink socket parent, retain socket permission 0600, bounded newline-delimited ping-only JSON requests with malformed/concatenated JSON rejection.
- **Local evidence:** `go test -race ./...` and `go vet ./...` passed; agent tests cover denied UIDs, disallowed ops, shared/symlink parents, malformed requests and valid ping.
- **Remote GitHub CI:** latest agent hardening Go Actions [run #40262754298](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/actions/runs/40262754298) **PASSED** (gofmt, Go race tests, vet). Previous preflight commit Go Actions [run 40262321339](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/actions/runs/40262321339) passed.
- **Safety:** agent still no privileged verb, not a root service and not approved for server mutations; phase P1 NOT COMPLETE.
- **Next:** review latest PR #14 CI, then security review of agent boundaries and development authentication limitations (#6/#8).

## LATEST SESSION — 2026-10-26 (Australia/Sydney), P1 authentication and metadata
- **Branch:** `feature/p1-auth-sessions-sqlite`, based on `feature/p1-core-foundation`; new [draft PR #15](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/pull/15). Both PRs are unmerged.
- **Added Go:** `internal/auth/sessions.go` and tests: random 256-bit session & CSRF secrets, hashed in-memory token registry, expiry, revocation, secure HTTPS host-only cookie constructors; no login HTTP wiring.
- **Added SQLite planning code:** `db/migrations/0001_initial.sql` with tenant, user, membership, session, job, attempt, audit schema and constraints; `db/test_schema.py` and `.github/workflows/schema-checks.yml`.
- **Local tests performed:** `go test -race ./...`, `go vet ./...` **PASS** on Go 1.23.2 developer source checkout; `python3 -m unittest discover -s db -p 'test_*.py' -v` **4/4 PASS**.
- **GitHub Actions:** [SQLite schema run #40310453620](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/actions/runs/40310453620) **PASS**. [Go checks run #40310453646](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/actions/runs/40310453646) **PASS** (gofmt, go test -race, go vet). Both remote workflows passed.
- **Issue progress:** #6 auth/MFA and #7 durable jobs updated with partial evidence, left open. Parent #14, architecture review #1/#2 and database ADR remain open.
- **NOT IMPLEMENTED:** production login/Argon2id, persistent sessions, actual Go SQL adapter, transactional job queue and worker, complete host agent security, installer, distro/restore testing. P1 still **IN PROGRESS**.
- **NEXT ACTION:** Verify Go Actions for PR #15, review/merge PR #14 first, resolve authentication and SQLite architecture/security signoff, then integrate SQL migration runner and auth session persistence with tests. No live VPS touched.

## CURRENT CHECKPOINT — READ FIRST

**Phase:** P0 architecture/security review pending; P1 core development IN PROGRESS (draft code).
**Phase state:** Seven phase plans, draft architecture ADR register, threat model, test strategy and report published; approval and deeper threat review still pending.
**Implementation state:** P1 developer prototype remains in [draft PR #14](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/pull/14); auth/session and SQLite schema foundations are in stacked [draft PR #15](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/pull/15); a Go SQLite queue prototype is being prepared on `feature/p1-sqlite-transactional-queue`. These drafts are unmerged and not production-ready. **P1 NOT COMPLETE.** No hosting app or installer exists.
**Production/release state:** NOT RELEASED.  
**Primary branch:** main (verify live branch HEAD before work).  
**Owner:** ParmTech.

## Work journal
### 2026-10-27 10:51 Australia/Sydney — P1 SQLite queue slice
- **Worker:** Codex, workstream C (storage/jobs) with read-only parallel review.
- **Task:** issue #7, incremental Go SQLite migration and transactional queue prototype.
- **Branch / commit / PR:** `feature/p1-sqlite-transactional-queue`, based on PR #15; commit and PR pending push.
- **Changes:** one canonical embedded SQLite migration; database opener with per-connection foreign-key enforcement and single-writer settings; transactional insert and state transitions; tenant-scoped reads and idempotency; Windows-specific JSON journal test portability; auth/session proposal and exact limitations documented in `docs/P1_AUTH_DATABASE_PROGRESS.md`.
- **Tests:** on Go 1.25.14 Windows/amd64, focused tests passed for `internal/database` and `internal/jobs`, plus `cmd/tongd`, `internal/api`, `internal/auth`, `internal/health`, and `internal/rbac`; `go vet` passed for these packages; `go build ./cmd/tongd` passed. Full `go test ./...` and race tests are blocked by Windows host/toolchain limitations recorded above. Python tests not run.
- **Security/licence:** only the no-op job kind is accepted; no worker or host mutation. SQLite driver is pinned; transitive licence inventory and ADR-003/threat review remain open. No production identity or session path added.
- **Next one step:** push the branch and open a draft PR stacked on #15; verify Linux Go race and Python schema checks before making any stronger test claim.

### 2026-10-26 — P0 documentation foundation
- **Worker:** ChatGPT, repo documentation session.
- **Repository:** https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel
- **Branch:** main
- **Task/state:** initial blueprint and handoff foundation — docs created/updated.
- **Work:** created planning specifications, feature matrix, upstream/licence research, security and installer scope, UX file explorer specification, milestone roadmap, agent protocol and contributor guide; upgraded README to document links.
- **Evidence:** links to individual documents in README. GitHub create-file and update-file actions returned commit SHA(s); review git history for exact most recent commit.
- **Tests:** no code tests executed (documentation-only). No VPS was accessed, modified, or deployed to.
- **Known limitations:** design is not implementation, proposed technology stack is not approved, up-to-date licence review needed before source reuse, unsupported distros not guaranteed.
- **Security/third party:** original AGPL code preferred; upstream references are research until independent licence/security review.
- **Next handoff:** read AGENTS.md, draft ADRs, create scoped P1 GitHub issues, seek maintainers' design review before coding.

### 2026-10-26 — P0 backlog handoff update
- **State:** planning issues recorded, not executed or assigned.
- **Created GitHub Issues:** #1 architecture ADRs, #2 threat model, #3 P1 scope, #4 UX flows.
- **Tests:** no implementation tests; issue/workflow-only updates.
- **Handoff:** start issue #1; check current branch/PRs and AGENTS.md before working.

### 2026-10-26 — P0 phase breakdown and P1 prototype
- **Worker:** ChatGPT, workstreams A/C/G planning and experimental unprivileged API.
- **Phase/state:** P0 documents prepared but security/ADR signoff pending; P1-01 prototype committed only to draft branch.
- **Repo:** parmtech/Tong-Panel; default main; feature branch feature/p1-01-loopback-health; [Draft PR #13](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/pull/13), related issue #5.
- **Files:** docs/phases/P0..P6, docs/PHASE_INDEX.md, ADR_REGISTER.md, THREAT_MODEL.md, TEST_STRATEGY.md, REPORT_2026-10-26.md; branch: go.mod, cmd/tongd/main.go, internal/health/handler.go and handler_test.go, .github/workflows/go-checks.yml.
- **Tests:** local Go 1.23.2 `go test ./...` passed; `go vet ./...` passed; locally formatted with gofmt. GitHub Actions Go checks run [#40256258155](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/actions/runs/40256258155) completed successfully: setup, gofmt, go test -race, go vet all green. Docs-only files received GitHub commit SHAs and references.
- **Security:** no public-root API, no installer or live-server modifications; design controls are unreviewed.
- **Blockers:** architecture ADRs need review, CI/PR approval, real distro support tests, security model acceptance.
- **Next step:** handle architecture review #1 and human code review of draft PR #13; do not call hosting features implemented.

### 2026-10-26 — Expanded P1 prototype and report
- **Worker:** ChatGPT, scoped P1 implementation in disposable local environment.
- **Phase/state:** P1 IN PROGRESS, not completed; P0 architecture/security review pending.
- **Branch/PR:** `feature/p1-core-foundation` → [draft PR #14](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/pull/14). Earlier [draft PR #13](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/pull/13) is superseded by inclusion in new PR and must be coordinated before merge.
- **Changes:** Go local API + tests, temporary token gate and RBAC, JSON journal and tests, TOTP primitive and tests, Unix-socket ping/peer-check agent and tests, tongctl doctor, responsive TypeScript UI with HTML/CSS/static assets, developer preview.
- **Evidence:** [P1 report](docs/PHASE1_REPORT_2026-10-26.md) and [GitHub Go checks success](https://github.com/parmtech/Tong-Panel/actions/runs/40260348235).
- **Tests:** local Go race/vet/build; TypeScript compiler; HTTP UI/API smoke. Remote GitHub Go CI PASSED. Not tested on clean VPS, no security penetration tests or full UI E2E.
- **Security:** intentionally no root operations; never expose experimental dev bearer API publicly. No production credentials or installer.
- **Blockers:** ADR/threat signoff, real production auth/MFA/session, DB/migrations and durable SQL queue, audited root agent, signer/installer and VM testing, full a11y review.
- **Next step:** Review architecture #1/#2, then implement production identity/migrations in reviewed PR; keep P1 gate open.
